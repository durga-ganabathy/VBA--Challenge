# VBA--Challenge
Module-2 VBA Challenge
Using VBA code- Looping through all the sheets in the workbook, I created the Ticker symbol in the summary table. 

Calculated the yearly change by subracting the closing price of the stock at the end of the year with the opening price of the stock at the beginning of the year. 

Using conditional formatting in the code (color index) higlighted 'yearly change' column the positive values in green and negative values in red. 

Then calculated the percentage change for the stock price for each of the ticker name. 

Using conditional formatting (Number format) converted the decimal values in the 'percent change' column. 

Calculated the total stock volume in the summary table. Additionally calculated the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease of the stock and greatest total volume.

I used the alphabetical testing file to test my code. Alphabetical testing dataset is smaller and it helped to run the code faster. Then I used the same code to test the multiple stock file. 

Module 2 Assignment challenge question:

Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

NOTE
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
